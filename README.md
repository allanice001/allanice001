### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Allanice001

I am a security architect and entrepreneur with experience in large-scale web applications and back-end systems, using a variety of coding languages, frameworks, and technologies. 
I am self-motivated and passionate about programming, from designing system architecture to diving deep into frameworks and problem solving.

In my spare time, I am mostly adding new skills to my repertoire and sometimes open-sourcing.
